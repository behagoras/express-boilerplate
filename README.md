# Express minimum Boilerplate 

This is my personal boilerplate for creating express api's with the very minimum, just install it and have an api with everything needed to expose an express api.

## Instalation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Develop with nodemon

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production Run

```bash
yarn start
```

## .env

Duplicate the file `.env.example` with the name `.env` and modify the settings according to the project.
